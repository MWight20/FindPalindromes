# FindPalindromes

 This page allows a user to select a text file where the file contains one word or string. 
After clicking "submit", the file will then be read and each line will be checked to see 
if it is a palindrome or not. If a line is checked and it is a palindrome, that word will 
be pushed into an array.

 After reading each line, the program will then sort through the 
palindrome array and order the list from least number of characters to most number of characters.
Once sorted, the program then opens a filestream and creates a new file that lists the newly created 
palindrome list, line by line.
